# Installation
Use of the [vatSys Plugin Manager](https://github.com/badvectors/PluginManager) is recommended for all users. Installation instructions are available in the project README.

If you have previously **manually** installed a previous version of OzStrips, ensure you delete the plugin files before installing via the Plugin Manager.

If you have a problem installing using the plugin manager, delete the `C:\Program Files (x86)\vatSys\bin\Plugins\OzStrips` folder if you have it.
