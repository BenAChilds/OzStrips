## Strip Colours
Departure strips are blue, while arrival strips are yellow.

## Strip Posting
You will only see strips for aircraft that have requested planned an ADES or ADEP of your aerodrome. Aircraft doing circuit work at your aerodrome, but not arriving or departing there will not receive a strip.
